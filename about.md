<h1 style="text-align:center">Hello World!</h1>
A very warm welcome to this web world of mine. I'm Prakhar Srivastava, a Data Associate and Machine Learning Engineer at [Atlan](https://atlan.com). I've a deep rooted interest for mathematics and physics in general but what I absolutely love is computers and latest technology.

<h2> About Blog </h2>

Since last couple of years, I've been in the machine learning and deep learning domain. I've explored a great deal of learning models and a lot of computational mathematics. After exploring these fundamentals behind AI and it's sub-disciplines, I figured there's a need of some external source of information to solve out this mystery of mathematics and learning. This blog is my effort to elucidate the nebulous of jargon existing in the field of Machine Learning.
